Project Topic Ideas
1. Secure Online Voting System
Overview: Build a web application for secure online voting in elections or organizational decisions. This project would involve database management for storing votes, user authentication, encryption, and secure data transmission.
Security Focus: Implement end-to-end encryption, user authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication), and auditing to ensure data integrity.
Data Science Angle: Analyze voting patterns or develop a feature that predicts outcomes based on historical data.

2. Personal Finance Management Tool
Overview: Create a web app that helps users manage their finances, track expenses, and set budgets. It could include features like automatic transaction categorization and financial goal tracking.
Security Focus: Secure handling of sensitive financial data, encryption of data at rest and in transit, and secure user authentication.
Data Science Angle: Implement machine learning algorithms to provide users with spending insights or financial predictions based on their habits.

3. Healthcare Appointment and Data Management System
Overview: Develop a platform that allows patients to book appointments, view their medical history, and receive reminders. It would involve handling sensitive medical data.
Security Focus: Compliance with regulations like HIPAA, encryption, and role-based access control to protect patient data.
Data Science Angle: Use data analytics to provide insights into patient care, optimize scheduling, or predict patient needs.

4. Smart City Data Dashboard
Overview: Create a web application that visualizes and analyzes data collected from various smart city sensors (traffic, air quality, etc.). The dashboard could provide insights to city planners and residents.
Security Focus: Secure data collection from IoT devices, data integrity checks, and secure data storage.
Data Science Angle: Develop predictive models for traffic management, pollution control, or energy usage based on collected data.

5. Secure File Sharing and Collaboration Platform
Overview: Build a web-based platform that allows users to share files securely and collaborate on documents in real-time. Think of it as a secure version of Google Drive with added features for team collaboration.
Security Focus: Implement strong encryption, secure user authentication, and permissions management.
Data Science Angle: Analyze collaboration patterns or provide insights on file usage and access.

6. E-commerce Platform with Fraud Detection
Overview: Develop an e-commerce website that includes a sophisticated fraud detection system. The platform would manage product listings, customer data, and transactions.
Security Focus: Secure payment processing, protection against SQL injection and other common web vulnerabilities, and robust user authentication.
Data Science Angle: Implement machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities in real-time, such as unusual purchasing patterns.

7. Cybersecurity Training and Awareness Platform
Overview: Create a platform that provides cybersecurity training modules, quizzes, and simulations for users to learn about common security threats (e.g., phishing, malware).
Security Focus: Ensure the platform itself is secure, with proper user authentication and data handling.
Data Science Angle: Analyze user progress, provide personalized recommendations for further training, and adapt training content based on user behavior.

8. Elo Rating System Platform
Overview: This would be a platform that allows managers of board game or esports leagues to set up game tracking and automatically build an elo system for that. Like existing platforms, it would provide tournament support, but the elo system would be what sets it apart.
Security Focus: Players and league managers would have their own accounts. League managers could grant players the ability to self-report game scores, or they could set it up so they must verify the results.
Data Science Angle: Apart from the obvious data analysis inherent in generating elo scores, game results would have to be kept in a database.
